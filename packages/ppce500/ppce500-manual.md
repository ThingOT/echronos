Introduction
-------------

The PowerPC e500 package provides support for a QEMU emulated PowerPC e500 machine.
It provides the following modules:

<dl>
  <dt>`build`</dt>
  <dd>A build module.</dd>

  <dt>`ctxt-switch`</dt>
  <dd>A module that implements context switching.</dd>

  <dt>`vectable`</dt>
  <dd>A module that generates an appropriate vector table for user configuration of interrupt handlers.</dd>

  <dt>`default-linker`</dt>
  <dd>A module that provides a default linker script.</dd>

  <dt>`interrupts-util`</dt>
  <dd>A module that provides assembly routines for query and manipulation of hardware interrupt state.</dd>

  <dt>`debug`</dt>
  <dd>A module that provides the *low-level debug* interface.</dd>

  <dt>`rtos-acamar`</dt>
  <dd>An RTOS variant that supports context switching between tasks via `yield_to()`.</dd>

  <dt>`rtos-gatria`</dt>
  <dd>An RTOS variant that supports round-robin scheduling, `yield()`, `block()`, `unblock()`, and mutexes.</dd>

  <dt>`rtos-kraz`</dt>
  <dd>An RTOS variant that supports round-robin scheduling, `yield()`, mutexes, and signals.</dd>

  <dt>`rtos-acrux`</dt>
  <dd>An RTOS variant that supports round-robin scheduling, interrupt events, `yield()`, `block()`, `unblock()`, and mutexes.</dd>

  <dt>`rtos-kochab`</dt>
  <dd>An RTOS variant that supports priority scheduling, mutexes with priority inheritance, semaphores, signals, and interrupts that cause task preemption and trigger the sending of signals.</dd>
</dl>

Please note that RTOS variants that provide interrupt events only support their use by *noncritical external* interrupts on PowerPC, and will not enable or disable any other types of interrupts.
Projects that define handlers for debug, critical, or machine check interrupts must enable them as needed, and cannot use the `interrupt_event_raise()` API or any other RTOS functionality.


`ppce500/build`
==============

The build module supports the *system build* interface.
It assumes the presence of a GNU PowerPC cross-compiler on PATH with toolchain prefix `powerpc-linux-gnu-`.
This toolchain can be obtained via a standard installation of the apt package `gcc-powerpc-linux-gnu`.

The system must also have an assigned linker-script.
The `default-linker` module may be used to provide a functional linker-script.

`ppce500/debug`
==============

The debug module supports the *low-level debug* interface.
It provides the `debug_putc` function.

### `debug_putc`

    void debug_putc(char c)

This function is not currently implemented, and is only a placeholder stub to assist GDB debugging.
Alternatively, the generic `debug_println` function may be another convenient location to place a breakpoint.

`ppce500/vectable`
=================

The `vectable` module provides a vector table implementation for the PowerPC e500.

It provides support for the user to provide a handler function for any of the following PowerPC e500 interrupts:

* `machine_check`
* `critical_input`
* `watchdog_timer`
* `debug`
* `system_call`
* `data_storage`
* `instruction_storage`
* `external_input`
* `alignment`
* `program`
* `floating_point`
* `aux_processor`
* `decrementer`
* `fixed_interval_timer`
* `data_tlb_error`
* `instruction_tlb_error`
* `eis_spe_apu`
* `eis_fp_data`
* `eis_fp_round`
* `eis_perf_monitor`

A user can configure the handler function for a system by setting the `handler` tag for the interrupt to the C identifier of the function in the system's `.prx` file, for example:

    <module name="ppce500.vectable">
      <fixed_interval_timer>
        <handler>tick_irq</handler>
      </fixed_interval_timer>
    </module>

In general, a user-supplied interrupt handler function like `tick_irq` in the example above MUST be responsible for clearing the hardware condition that caused its interrupt.

### Preemption support

When configuring a system using an RTOS variant that provides preemption support (such as Kochab), the `vectable` module must must have the `preemption` tag set to `true` in the `.prx` file:

    <module name="ppce500.vectable">
      <preemption>true</preemption>
    </module>

(Note: when `preemption` is enabled, the system call vector is no longer available for configuration, as the RTOS makes use for this vector internally to implement preemption support.)

On preemption-supporting RTOS variants, interrupts of the *non-critical* class may be configured as being `preempting`, by setting their `preempting` tag to `true` in the `.prx` file:

    <module name="ppce500.vectable">
      <preemption>true</preemption>
      <fixed_interval_timer>
        <handler>tick_irq</handler>
        <preempting>true</preempting>
      </fixed_interval_timer>
    </module>

The user should configure an interrupt as `preempting` when its interrupt handler has the potential to cause task preemption.
Handler functions marked `preempting` MUST return a boolean value that is true if the handler has just made an action with the potential to cause a preemption, such as raising an interrupt event.
These requirements must be adhered to for the RTOS to be able to enforce its scheduling policies.

### Floating-point support

On PowerPC e500, floating-point functionality is provided by the Signal Processing Engine (SPE), an application processing unit (APU).
Thus, programs using floating-point operations must be compiled with a toolchain that supports the SPE instruction set.

By default, the RTOS will preserve single-precision floating point values during interrupts and across context switch, as they are held by the regular 32-bit general-purpose registers (GPRs).

To enable support for the preservation of double-precision floating values (which are held in 64-bit SPE registers), set the `spe_64bit_support` option to `true` for both the `vectable` module and the RTOS module in the `.prx` file:

    <module name="ppce500.vectable">
      <spe_64bit_support>true</spe_64bit_support>
      ...
    </module>
    ...
    <module name="ppce500.rtos-phact">
      <spe_64bit_support>true</spe_64bit_support>
      ...
    </module>

(Note that the `spe_64bit_support` feature is currently only implemented for the RTOS variants that provide preemption support.)

With this feature enabled, at runtime the RTOS will ensure tasks whose `MSR[SPE]` bit is set will have their 64-bit SPE register values preserved.
Tasks that do not have the `MSR[SPE]` bit set will only have their 32-bit GPR values preserved.

For convenience, the `vectable` module also offers an optional default handler for the `eis_spe_apu` interrupt that when activated, sets the `MSR[SPE]` bit to enable the use of SPE APU instructions - enable this feature by setting the `eis_spe_auto_enable` tag to `true` in the `.prx` file:

    <module name="ppce500.vectable">
      <eis_spe_auto_enable>true</eis_spe_auto_enable>
      ...
    </module>

This may be a useful default behavior for automatically enabling SPE functionality (including 64-bit SPE register preservation) only for those tasks that actually make use of it.
