*Does the AGPL license also apply to programs that use the eChronos RTOS kernel?*

Yes.
The license also covers user programs that use the eChronos RTOS services through API calls.
Linking the eChronos RTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is considered making a combined work based on the eChronos RTOS.
Thus, the terms and  conditions of the AGPLv3 cover the whole combination (see: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLStaticVsDynamic).

We specifically do not provide a FreeRTOS-like exception to the license.
